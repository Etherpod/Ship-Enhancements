Ship Enhancements adds way too much stuff to the ship, all of which you can find in the mod settings menu. Any changes to the ship will be applied on the next loop. Experiment and have fun!

To answer some questions you may have...

## Is this mod compatible with [Quantum Space Buddies](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/quantumspacebuddies/)?
Yep! Whoever hosts the game will have control over the settings.

## How am I supposed to carry all of these new items?
I made a mod called [Traveler's Pack](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/travelerspack/) to address this problem. Try playing with it enabled if you run into the issue of there being too many items.

## Does this mod support [Achievements+](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/achievements/)?
It sure does! It adds 12 new achievements that you can try and unlock.

# Feature Overview

## Disable Ship Parts
Permanently remove useless or very important parts of the ship.
- **Gravity Crystal**: You are now only affected by outside sources of gravity. If you're in space you'll just float.
- **Headlights**: Disables your ship's headlights and landing camera light. You may need to rely on your scout for light.
- **Landing Camera**: Good luck.
- **Eject Button**: Covers the eject button with tape so that your friend can't keep ejecting the cockpit while you're trying to fly.
- **Interior/Exterior Lights**: Makes your ship very dark.
- **Automatic Lights**: Prevents the lights from turning off when you leave the ship.
- **Oxygen**: Literally removes all of the oxygen in the ship unless you're near trees or in an oxygen-filled atmosphere. This takes priority over all of the other oxygen modifications.
- **Ship Scout Recall**: Removes your ability to recall the scout using the ship. The scout must be manually docked on the ship's scout launcher to fire, and can only be recalled using the handheld scout launcher.
- **Ship Scout Launching**: Removes your ability to launch the scout from the ship. You'll have to do this yourself outside of the ship.
- **Handheld Scout Recall**: Removes your abillity to recall the scout on foot. If you shoot your scout somewhere, you'll have to walk over and pick it up by hand to use it again. If you accidentally launch it into deep space, don't worry; if the ship can still recall it, you can go retrieve it from the top of the ship in the scout launcher.
- **Thrusters**: Lets you turn off your backward, horizontal, or vertical thrusters, or all of them except the forward thrusters if you really want a challenge.
- **Damage Indicators**: Turns off all of those pesky notifications about parts of your ship being damaged, including the master alarm. Keep an eye or four on the reactor, please.
- **Seatbelt**: Breaks a number of state laws by removing your seatbelt. If you crash into something with enough force you'll fly out of the chair.
- **Ship Suit**: Removes your spacesuit from the ship. Space exploration just got a whole lot more dangerous.
- **Medkit**: Prevents you from healing inside the ship. Marshmallows might end up being your only way to regain health.
- **Hatch**: Removes the hatch, leaving a gaping hole in your ship. Be careful when you're walking around in there!
- **Single-Use Tractor Beam**: Turns off the ship's tractor beam after you enter the ship for the first time. If you leave without your suit, you might have trouble getting back in again.
- **Air/Water Auto Roll**: Lets you fly around upside down in air and water, which is really confusing when paired with no ship gravity. Also makes it easier to land on walls, if you wanted to do that.
- **Fluid Prevention**: Makes it possible for fluids to enter your ship. Make sure your suit is on before you start flying around underwater.
- **Hazard Prevention**: Makes it possible for outside hazards to injure you inside the ship. Don't fly too close to the sun!
- **Lock-on**: Removes your ability to lock on to objects. How well can you judge distances without the lock-on to tell you?
- **HUD Markers**: Hides the on-screen markers that tell you the location of your ship, your scout, and any marked ship log locations. Ship log locations inside The Stranger are left visible until you arrive.
- **Minimap Markers**: Hides the icons on the minimap globe that tell you the location of your ship, your scout, and yourself.

## Adjust Ship Functions
Change some of the ways the ship works to make gameplay easier, harder, or just more chaotic.
- **Oxygen Drain Multiplier**: Larger numbers make your ship's oxygen drain faster. Set it to something like 100 for it to completely drain after being in the ship for half the loop or so.
- **Fuel Drain Multiplier**: Larger numbers make your ship's fuel drain faster.
- **Oxygen Tank Drain Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the amount of oxygen that drains when the ship's oxygen tank is damaged.
- **Fuel Tank Drain Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the amount of fuel that drains when the ship's fuel tank is damaged.
- **Idle Fuel Consumption Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase how quickly your fuel drains over time. If the **Engine Switch** is enabled, it will not drain fuel while the ship is off.
- **Damage Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the damage done to the ship hull and increase the probability that components will be damaged on impact.
- **Damage Speed Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the speed you need to be traveling at before taking damage. Set this to something really small to blow up your ship when you touch something.
- **Random Hull Damage**: Applies random damage to a random set of hulls on the start of the loop. The slider controls the percentage of hulls to be damaged- minimum is none, maximum is all of them- and how much damage to do to them.
- **Random Component Damage**: Breaks a set number of random components at the start of the loop. The silder controls the percentage of components to be damaged, where the minimum is none and the maximum is all of them. The vital ship components (reactor, fuel tank, one random thruster) are excluded from being selected.
- **Enable Stun Damage**: Blocks all of your inputs for a short time after you crash. The harder you hit something, the longer you'll be frozen.
- **Enable Fragile Ship**: Prevents you from moving your ship if the ship is damaged at all.
- **Prevent System Failure**: Keeps your ship up and running as long as the cockpit is still attached.
- **Repair Limit**: Sets a limit on how many parts you can repair before ship repair is completely disabled.
- **Repair Time Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the time it takes to repair parts of your ship.
- **Ship Gravity Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the strength of your ship's gravity crystal. Large numbers are advised against, however, as exiting your ship will kill you.
- **Ship Gravity Direction**: Lets you change the direction of your ship's gravity. Set this to Random if you feel like the game isn't painful enough.
- **Atmosphere/Space Angular Drag Multiplier**: Larger numbers make it harder to turn your ship. Setting this to 0 lets you spin your ship forever.
- **Disable Rotation Speed Limit**: Lets you spin your ship as quickly as you want. Enabling this may quickly lead to motion sickness.
- **Air Drag Multiplier**: Larger numbers make atmospheres slow you down more. Setting this to 0 lets your ship drift endlessly through the air.
- **Cyclone Chaos**: Determines how violently cyclones should affect your ship.
- **Ship Water Damage**: Determines how much damage your ship should sustain while submerged in water. Max damage will instantly blow up your ship.
- **Ship Sand Damage**: Determines how much damage your ship should sustain while being bombarded by falling sand. Max damage will instantly blow up your ship.
- **Prolong Digestion**: Lets you survive for a short period of time while your ship is being digested.
- **Ship Explosion Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the size of the explosion that is created when your ship blows up. Don't go above 30.
- **Extra Explosion Damage**: Gives explosions the ability to damage your ship and fragments of Brittle Hollow. Also lets you kill anglerfish.
- **Ship Noise Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the distance your ship can be detected by noise detectors.
- **Extra Noise**: Makes noisy parts of the ship, like the master alarm, alert noise detectors.
- **Reactor Lifetime Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the time it takes for the reactor to blow up when it has been damaged. Set this to something small to give yourself a panic attack every time the master alarm goes off.
- **Ship Friction**: Lets you adjust how much friction to apply to the ship.
- **Ship Bounciness**: Larger numbers increase the bounciness of the ship. Values above 1 will be less accurate and will no longer affect players.
- **Ship Input Latency**: This basically simulates internet lag, where larger numbers increase the time it takes for the ship to process your inputs. A value of 1 means it takes 1 second for your "upwards thrust" input to register.
- **Funny Sounds**: Replaces some of the in-game sounds with silly sound effects.

## Add Ship Features
Some new stuff that Slate didn't have time to include in the ship.
- **Oxygen Refill**: Refills the ship's oxygen tank when it gets close to trees or enters an oxygen-filled atmosphere.
- **Oxygen Refill Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the speed at which your ship's oxygen tank refills when near an oxygen source.
- **Fuel Transfer**: Lets you transfer your jetpack fuel to the ship's fuel tank to refill it.
- **Jetpack Refuel Drain**: Drains the ship's fuel reserve when you refuel your jetpack. You cannot duplicate fuel by transferring it back into the ship.
- **Fuel Transfer Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the speed of fuel transfers. You will transfer fuel to the ship faster, but refueling will drain the ship faster too (if refuel drain is enabled).
- **Automatic Hatch**: Automatically closes the hatch when you leave the ship. **Quantum Space Buddies** has this feature by default.
- **Extra Eject Buttons**: Adds a few more eject buttons that all eject different parts of the ship.
- **Interactable Ship Curtain**: Lets you close the curtain inside the ship, blocking off the cockpit.
- **Ship Warp Core**: Attaches a Nomai warp core to your ship's cockpit. You can press the button on the ceiling of the cockpit to activate the warp core, which will warp your ship back to where it was at the start of the loop.
  - The component option for this setting turns the warp core into a damageable component. Activating the return warp while it's damaged may have unintended results.
- **Temperature Zones**: Implements a temperature mechanic for the ship using the "TEMP" (temperature) dial and a new "SHIP TEMP" (ship temperature) dial. Subjecting your ship to extreme temperatures will increase the ship temperature, making it more likely for your ship to sustain damage or bad side effects.
  - Any extreme temperatures can damage your ship if temperature damage is enabled. The temperature dial will start flashing if the temperature reaches a dangerous level.
  - High temperatures (very hot) will make your ship hull hot to the touch and can blow up the Portable Fuel Tank.
  - Low temperatures (very cold) will lower the strength of your ship's thrusters and make it possible for your ship ignition to fail.
- **Hull Temperature Damage**: Makes it possible for extreme temperatures to damage the hull of your ship.
- **Component Temperature Damage**: Makes it possible for extreme temperatures to damage any of your ship's components, like the headlights or artificial gravity.
- **Temperature Damage Multiplier**: Larger numbers increase the damage done to your ship by extreme temperatures.
- **Temperature Resistance Multiplier**: Larger numbers make the ship temperature change slower, giving you more time in extreme temperatures but requiring more time to recover.
- **Faulty Heat Regulators**: Makes your ship unable to dump the reactor heat, leaving it to build up in the ship. Unless you find someplace cold, your ship is going to constantly rise in temeprature.
- **Repair Confirmation**: Plays a sound when everything has been repaired. Now you don't need to go searching for any hulls you forgot to fix!
- **Hazardous Thrusters**: Makes your ship's thruster flames actually damage you. Try figuring out how to get near them in the first place.
- **Cockpit Rust Level**: Controls how much rust is applied to the ship cockpit. Moving the slider all the way to the right completely covers the cockpit in rust.
- **Dirt Accumulation Time**: Larger numbers increase the time (in seconds) it takes for dirt to build up on your cockpit glass, which you can wash off by finding a source of water (or something similar to it). Set this to 0 to disable it.
- **Max Dirt Accumulation**: Stops dirt from building up on your cockpit when it reaches a certain level.
- **Scout Launcher Component**: Turns the ship's scout launcher into a fully functioning ship component. If you damage it, you won't be able to launch or recall your scout from the ship until you repair it.
- **Ship Scout Photo Mode**: Lets you switch to photo mode on the ship's scout launcher. It will default to photo mode if scout launching is disabled.
- **Signalscope Component**: Turns the ship's signalscope into a fully functioning ship component. If you damage it, you won't be able to receive or broadcast signals from the ship until you repair it.
- **Ship Signal**: Adds a signal for the ship on the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency. The signal will stop if the ship's signalscope is damaged. Slate also said they added a "command transmitter" to your signalscope, whatever that means.
- **Ship Horn**: Lets you honk by pressing the flashlight keybind while the ship's signalscope is equipped. You can pick from a variety of horn noises.
- **Clock**: Adds a clock to the cockpit that tells the time in minutes and seconds. It makes a nice ticking sound, if you like that sort of background noise.
- **Ernesto**: Adds Ernesto to the cockpit. You can talk to him if you're bored.
- **Ship Item Placement**: Lets you place items inside or on top of your ship.
- **Add Repair Wrench**: Adds a repair wrench to the cockpit. You need to be holding this to make any repairs.
- **Portable Campfire**: Adds a portable campfire to the ship next to your suit. Set it up wherever you want and roast a marshmallow.
- **Portable Tractor Beam**: Adds a portable Nomai tractor beam to the ship near the ship log. Place it down somewhere if you need an extra boost in height.
- **Portable Fuel Canister**: Adds a portable fuel tank inside the ship at the back. You can bring it around with you in case you need to refuel your jetpack while traveling. The fuel tank can completely refill your jetpack about 3 times before it runs out of fuel.
- **Expedition Flag**: Adds a portable flag to the ship between the cockpit and the supplies section. Placing it down will add a flag marker to your minimap.
  - You can add custom images to the **Expedition Flag**! If that sounds interesting, navigate to this mod's folder using the mod manager and open the folder named "ExpeditionFlagIcons".
- **Add Radio**: Adds a radio to the cockpit. You can tune in to radio stations by inputting a 4-digit code. Slate posted the codes for a few of the classics on the wall behind the radio.
- **Ship Tether**: Adds a few hooks to the ship cabin. You can attach these hooks to pretty much any surface- including the ship- and tether yourself to them. If you want to get even crazier, grab a second hook after tethering to one and tether to the new one; it will connect the two hooks together.
- **Unlimited Items**: Lets you duplicate items inside the ship. This doesn't work on the ship's gravity crystal or items from other mods.
- **Removable Gravity Crystal**: Lets you detach the ship's gravity crystal and place it somewhere else to create a localized gravity field. The removed gravity crystal will have the same strength as it did in the ship.
- **Gravity Landing Gear**: Adds an interface to the cockpit that controls the new gravity technology built into your ship's landing gear. It will stop working if your landing gear is damaged.
  - The purple switch turns the gravity landing gear on/off.
  - The green switch inverts the gravity, pushing you away from surfaces instead of pulling you towards them.
- **Thrust Modulator**: Adds an interface to the cockpit that lets you lower or disproportionately raise the maximum thrust your ship can use. Stacks with the smooth thrust option from General Enhancements.
  - The orange buttons let you set a limit on your maximum thrust.
  - The two rectangular buttons to the left of the orange buttons control the overdrive. Press the green button to disable the safeties, then once the bottom button turns yellow, press it to activate the overdrive. It is recommended to buckle up before using overdrive.
- **Auto Align Controls**: Adds an interface to the cockpit that lets you automatically rotate your ship to face the current lock-on target.
  - The right button turns auto alignment on/off. Lock onto something to use the feature.
  - The left button controls how your ship faces towards the target. Turning it on rotates your ship so that the bottom faces the target, and turning it off rotates the ship so that the cockpit faces the target.
- **Autopilot Controls**: Adds an interface to the cockpit that lets you control the new features added to the ship's autopilot system.
  - The interface is divided into two sections: autopilot override (the left 2 buttons) and match velocity override (the right 3 buttons). The two buttons that are currently selected control what engaging autopilot or matching velocity will do.
  - The top left button activates the default autopilot function. It will fly towards the lock-on target.
  - The bottom left button activates orbital autopilot, which will find a stable orbit around the lock-on target.
  - The center button activates input hold. While in recording mode, give the ship a thrust input and turn off recording mode while holding that input. It will keep holding that thrust until you turn off input hold.
  - The top right button activates the default match velocity. It will match velocity with whatever your lock-on target is.
  - The bottom right button activates position hold. It will remain at whatever position you activate it at relative to the lock-on target.
- **Engine Switch**: Controls your ship's power and engine. The switch needs to be turned on if you want to fly your ship.
  - If the **Idle Fuel Consumption Multiplier** is above 0, it will only consume fuel when the ship is on.

## Decoration
Haven't you ever wished your ship had a little more color?
- **Ship Light Color**: Changes the color of the ship's interior and exterior lights from a wide variety of options. Set this to Divine at your own risk, for mere Hearthians were never meant to see creations blessed by a god.
- **Interior/Exterior Hull Color**: Select from a variety of colors to change the inside or outside color of your ship. Just don't pick Rainbow.
- **Ship Thruster Flame Color**: Changes the color of the ship's thruster flames as well as the color of the thruster indicator inside of the ship.
- **Damage Indicator Color**: Changes the color of the ship damage display, the master alarm, the reactor, and the damage indicator lights.

Enabling color blending lets you fade the ship decoration between different colors based on certain parameters. For example, I could set it to change the lights to red if the ship is hot and change the lights to blue if the ship is cold. Here is an overview on the different parameter options:
- **Time**: Fades between colors over time.
- **Fuel**: Changes colors as your fuel gets lower.
- **Oxygen**: Changes colors as your oxygen gets lower.
- **Ship Damage %**: Sets the color based on how many ship parts are damaged.
- **Reactor State**: Sets the color based on the reactor's current state, whether it be undamaged, damaged, or about-to-explode.
- **Velocity**: Sets the color based on whether you're moving towards or away from your current lock-on target.
- **Gravity**: Changes colors as your ship experiences a stronger gravitational pull.
- **Temperature**: Changes colors as the environment becomes warmer or colder.
- **Ship Temperature**: Changes colors as your ship becomes warmer or colder.

## Quality of Life
Some bug fixes or small things that it wouldn't make sense to play without.
- **Keep Helmet On**: When there is no oxygen present, this prevents the game from removing your helmet when doing things such as piloting the ship or roasting a marshmallow at a campfire.
- **Show Warning Notifications**: Notifies you in the ship when resources are low or when the outside conditions are becoming dangerous.
- **Fix Ship Gravity**: Gets rid of that annoying bug where you're trying to land on the Sun Station and you can't move around in your ship because it's holding you against the wall.
- **Split Ship Lock-on**: (Disabled by default) Separates your ship lock-on target and your suit lock-on target. If you lock onto something while piloting the ship, the ship will continue using that as the target if you exit the seat and lock onto something else.
- **Always Allow Map Lock-on**: Lets you use the lock-on feature on the map while you're standing on a planet.
- **Fix Ship Thrust Indicator**: Fixes a bug where the ship's thrust indicator turns off when you stop piloting the ship.

## Presets
In case there are too many settings to deal with, there are some pre-made presets for you to use. The settings can still be meddled with after choosing one.

- **Vanilla Plus** - Turns everything off except for the Quality of Life changes.
- **Minimal** - Disables anything that could be considered useful.
- **Impossible** - Makes it very difficult to keep your ship in one piece.
- **New Stuff** - Adds all the new stuff to your ship.
- **Pandemonium** - I just turned everything on for this one. Good luck.
- **Random** - Randomizes all of the options each loop. This preserves the settings you had selected previously, so just switch back to the **Custom** preset when you're done.
    - You can control the Random preset with two sliders: **Randomizer Iterations** and **Randomizer Difficulty**.
	  - **Randomizer Iterations** controls how many of the settings to randomize each loop, ranging from only a handful of settings to nearly all of them.
	  - **Randomizer Difficulty** controls how likely it is for difficult settings to be chosen. Minimum difficulty completely removes all of the difficult settings, like **Disable Ship Suit**.
	- You can also control the preset using the **RandomizerSettings.json** file in the mod folder, which lets you choose settings to include/exclude from the randomizer.

## API
To use the API, copy the **IShipEnhancements** script from this mod's GitHub repository into your own project, then follow [these instructions](https://owml.outerwildsmods.com/guides/apis.html#consuming-apis) on the OWML docs.

- **CreateTemperatureZone()** - In case you're a modder and want to add your own high/low temperature zones. Temperature zones can stack, and will just take the sum of the temperatures.
- **GetSettingsProperty()** - Returns the value of a config setting as seen from the player. These values only update at the beginning of the loop, so changing the mod settings doesn't affect them.
- **SetSettingsProperty()** - Lets you change the value of a config setting in the middle of the loop. Note that this change will be reverted on the next loop.
- **SetSettingsOptionVisible()** - Lets you set the visibility of a settings option in the mod settings menu. If an option is hidden, it cannot be changed by the user but can still be changed in code.
- **HideAllSettings()** - Removes all of the settings from the mod settings menu.
- **ShowAllSettings()** - Returns any hidden settings to the mod settings menu.
- **GetPreShipInitializeEvent()** and **GetPostShipInitializeEvent()** - Subscribe to these events to run code before and after Ship Enhancements makes any changes to the ship.

## Known Bugs
- When playing in multiplayer and using Input Latency, the delayed inputs of the non-hosts will not work once they leave the flight console
- If you attach yourself to an object with a tether and the object enters a black hole, there is a chance you will be violently thrown across the solar system
- The Portable Campfire can be lit inside the core of Giant's Deep
- Reeling in towards a tether hook on the other side of a wall will sometimes produce unintended side effects
- The Expedition Flag's map marker may not be visible when using the advanced minimap from General Enhancements
- The Continuous Matching Velocity feature from General Enhancements may cause bugs when used with the Autopilot Controls
- Placing the ship's gravity crystal on the landing gear and then detaching the landing gear will crash the game
